# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction Project

This project analyzes a heart disease dataset and builds a machine-learning model to predict the presence of heart disease based on various clinical attributes. The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

**📌 Project Overview**


The goal of this project is to:

- Inspect and clean the dataset

- Handle missing values and duplicate records

- Explore relationships between features

- Visualize correlations and important patterns

- Train and evaluate a Logistic Regression model

 -Predict heart disease outcomes for test samples

The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (heart_disease.ipynb) using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.
